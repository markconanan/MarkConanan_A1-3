#### **Usability Considerations**
1. While the website can be displayed in all screen sizes, it would be best to be displayed in desktop or if in mobile with a landscape orientation.
2. The website uses google fonts, and will not display correctly if not connected to the internet or if the google fonts service is discontinued.

### **Short Answers Q&A**
#### **Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)**
At the beginning of the 80s, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), emerge as the protocol for ARPANET. DNS was also established shortly after. Around 1986 The National Science Foundationâ€™s NSFNET goes online.

Tim Berners-Lee develops HTML at the beginning of the 90s. This also heralds the dot-com boom as Netscape, Yahoo!, Amazon.com, Craigslist, eBay, Netflix and Google go live in this decade. It bursts in 2000 as vulnerabilities in the internet arise. 

In the 2000s, social networks started to arise, with MySpace, Facebook, Youtube, Reddit, Twitter going live. Smartphones have also been launched, enabling people to have ubiquitous access to the internet.

#### **Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)**
A web browser is the software application used to access information in the internet. With the Domain or Domain name, the address of the website which points to an IP address, browsers are able to retrieve and display the information from the web servers which hosts the data of the website. If the website is a website that has not been visited before (therefor the IP address is not in the cache) the web browser will contact the DNS server which contains the record of the IP address for the particular domain name or address.

#### **Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)**
Internet ushered in the information age and has greatly impacted how the world works today in countless ways. One is enabling remote access to information systems and changing how global businesses operate. This has enabled companies to process and send information faster across business units thus leading to better business decisions. It has also enabled them to have people access their systems anywhere, thus enabling remote work, and even making outsourcing work to other locations possible instead of having one central head office where all the operations are located. This has changed the business landscape and enabled companies to expand bigger than ever as barriers of distance are becoming less important with information being able to flow freely and instantly.
